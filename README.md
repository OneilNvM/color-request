# Color Request
This tool is used to generate an image of a color based on the RGB, Hex, or HSL values inputted.
### Generate an image
1. Select which mode you want to use between RGB, Hex, or HSL
2. Input the values specific to the mode
3. Enter a folder path for where to store the image (absolute path)
### Future Improvements
- Allow user to input own image size value
- Add two image colors (Additive and Subtractive)
